        <p>I've worked in a lot of different fields, but ive never been this excited about what im transitioning into before. I feel that learning to code has and will continue to expand my potential to become an independent entrepeneur in the future, but for now I am very excited to begin working with the Boulder Galvanize's Full Stack instructors, and seeking an opportunity to be employed by a company that values innovation and growth, so that I may sharpen my own skills while helping to achieve the company's vision. I also enjoy programming because language has always fascinated me, and the way in which programming languages develop to become more powerful and descriptive methods for communicationg thoughts into visible representations, provides truly limitless potential to explore, learn from, and build on their ever evolving platforms. </p>


		<header id="tab"><p>Background</p></header>

        <p>Aside from some SQL and Visual Basic at the end of my studies at the Leeds School of Business at CU, my actual work experience has been pretty far removed from coding. I worked for two years at Illegal Pete's as a bartender and manager, and last year to present I was working as a winemaker and sales rep for Bookcliff Vineyards. In my free time however I have experimented with quite a few languages and am proficient at graphic design and audio engineering.

        I am orginally from Colorado Springs, but I have lived in Boulder the past 5 years. I plan on moving somewhere else after the cohort, but am playing it fast and loose as of now to keep my options open and my future malleable.</p>
